I like to get to the bottom of things, whether it's investment analysis or engineering optimization. 

It's frustrating to see decision-makers stuck in the passenger seat, passively evaluating static projects. I'm inviting them to the driver's seat, redesigning the models into a multitude of choices and helping find what really works under uncertainty.

I'm open to research collaborations, guest lectures, and occasional consulting. Get in touch!
