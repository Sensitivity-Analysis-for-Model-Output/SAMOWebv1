I like to get to the bottom of things, whether it's investment analysis or engineering optimization. 

Bridging corporate experience, consulting practice, and academic deep dives, I focus on developing easy-to-use yet insight-rich methods for analyzing computational models. I enjoy working with teams from different backgrounds and helping them truly understand and improve their models.

I'm open to research collaborations, guest lectures, and occasional consulting. Get in touch!
