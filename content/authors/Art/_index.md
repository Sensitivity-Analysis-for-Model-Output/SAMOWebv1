My research interests are in high dimensional integration, nonparametric confidence intervals, variable importance measures and crossed random effects. The classes that I teach are primarily graduate courses in applied statistics. 

I also frequently teach the statistical consulting course. I am a co-founder and co-director of the Stanford statistics industrial affiliates program. This program connects our departments to industrial settings in which statistical ideas are applied.
