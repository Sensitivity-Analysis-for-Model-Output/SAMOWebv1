Passionate about applied mathematics.

I am a scientist working at the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre, focusing on agricultural resilience, Earth observation, and data-driven decision support for sustainable food systems. My work connects meteorology, AI, operational research and supply-chain modelling to quantify uncertainty and strengthen agricultural monitoring under crisis and climate stress conditions.

At the JRC, I contribute to research and innovation projects that combine remote-sensing technologies, simulation frameworks, and statistical learning to assess crop production, logistics, and post-war recovery dynamics, with a particular focus on Ukraine. My experience spans the integration of ensemble forecasting, uncertainty quantification and global sensitivity analysis, and agronomic analysis to translate scientific results into operational insights for resilience planning and support decision-making needs.

My goal is to connect science, technology, and policy in ways that foster resilience, transparency, and innovation, strengthening Europe’s capacity to anticipate risks, manage resources, and ensure food security through data-informed decision-making.
